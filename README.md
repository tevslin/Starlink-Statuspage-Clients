# Starlink-Statuspage-Clients
Windows Clients to upload Starlink performance data to Starlinkstatus.space

The developers of Starlink Statuspage, \Tysonpower and \puchol decribe it this way:

"Starlinkstatus.space is a Website that offers Statistics of Starlink Users around the World. All Data is Collected by Users that are interested in the Performance of Starlink....".

They offer a client for contributing data at https://github.com/Tysonpower/starlinkstatus for Linux, Macs, and Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL) Version 2. If you are running Linux, a Mac, or are comfortable wih WLS2, you should the cliebt and install instructions from that repository.

The purpose of alternative client(s) offered here is make it possible for more people to contribute data to Starlink Statuspage and help make the site even more useful at even more locations. The first client , which will appear here soon, here is for Windows users who don't want to or can't run WSL 2 and those for whom installing a WSL client may be too tine consuming or technically demanding.

Neither Starlink Status page nor I have any official connection with Starlink. I am a Starlink user.
