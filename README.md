# Starlink-Statuspage-Client

Almosty self-installing Windows client to upload Starlink performance data to [Starlink Statuspage](https://Starlinkstatus.space).

The developers of Starlink Statuspage, \Tysonpower and \puchol, describe it this way:

"Starlinkstatus.space is a Website that offers Statistics of Starlink Users around the World. All Data is Collected by Users that are interested in the Performance of Starlink....".

They offer a client for contributing data at https://github.com/Tysonpower/starlinkstatus for Linux, Macs, and Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL) Version 2. If you are running Linux, a Mac, or are comfortable wih WLS2, you should get the client and install instructions from that repository.

The purpose of the alternative client offered here is make it possible for more people to contribute data to Starlink Statuspage and help make the site even more useful at even more locations, especially as Starlink itself emerges from Beta into full production. This client is for  is for Windows 10 users who don't want to or can't run WSL 2 and those for whom installing a WSL client may be too ti,e consuming or technically demanding.

Neither Starlink Statuspage nor I have any official connection with Starlink nor with eachother.

## Prerequisites
